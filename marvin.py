This program is the main program.
The basic functionality of the program is same as alexa or any other Voice controlled virtual assistant AI
The program activates on the word marvin and once it recognises your voice, you can ask anything from it which are programed.

The program can either be forced stoped or you have to say "marvin" then once it recognize your voice you have to say "can you stop now"
